# League of Memory

A web game where the player must click on each League of Legends champion only once. There are a couple of difficulties, with harder difficulties having more cards at once.

The app uses Riot Games' API to get every champion (currently there are 167) and to put their name alongside a picture of them on screen.

The images are preloaded so as to not interfere with gameplay.
